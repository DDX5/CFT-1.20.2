# CFT-1.20.2
Creative Firework Tools. Minecraft 1.20.2 Neoforge Mod

This mod allows creative mode players and server ops/admins to create custom fireworks without the need for NBT data knowledge.
By using a few basic commands, this mod is designed to achieve greater customizability than the built-in features that vanilla offer.
Also included is the barrage block which when given the correct setup by using selected items can be triggered to perform a display on it's own.
